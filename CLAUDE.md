### 1. Plan Mode Default
- Enter plan mode for ANY not-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions)
- Use plan mode for verification steps, not just building
- Write detailed specs upfront to reduce ambiguity

### 2. Self-Improvement Loop
- After ANY correction from the user: update `tasks/lessons.md` with the pattern
- Write rules for yourself that prevent the same mistake
- Ruthlessly iterate on these lessons until the mistake rate drops
- Review lessons at session start for a project

### 3. Verification Before Done
- Never mark a task complete without proving it works
- Diff behavior between main and your changes when relevant
- Ask yourself: "Would a staff engineer approve this?"
- Run tests, check logs, demonstrate correctness

### 4. Demand Elegance (Balanced)
- For non-trivial changes: pause and ask "is there a more elegant way?"
- If a fix feels hacky: "Knowing everything I know now, implement the elegant solution"
- Skip this for simple, obvious fixes. Don't overengineer
- Challenge your own work before presenting it

## Core Principles
- **Simplicity First**: Make every change as simple as possible. Impact minimal code
- **No Laziness**: Find root causes. No temporary fixes. Senior developer standards

## Docker Hub Publish

- When the user asks to "push current image to dockerhub" (or any phrasing of the same intent), follow the blueprint in [`docs/DOCKER_HUB.md`](docs/DOCKER_HUB.md): **always recreate** the image from the current working tree (remove → build → push). **Push to Docker Hub ONLY — do NOT deploy to `subzero`** (no SSH, no `docker compose pull`/`up`, no disk guard, no health check). Never push a stale local tag without rebuilding. Stop once the push completes and the new image id/digest is confirmed. Target image: `developabror/orient-advertise-backend:latest`. (Subzero deploy is now a separate, manual step the user runs themselves.)

## Project General Instructions

- Always use the latest versions of dependencies.
- Always write Java code as the Spring Boot application.
- Always use Maven for dependency management.
- Always create test cases for the generated code both positive and negative.
- Always generate the CircleCI pipeline in the .circleci directory to verify the code.
- Minimize the amount of code generated.
- The Maven artifact name must be the same as the parent directory name.
- Use semantic versioning for the Maven project. Each time you generate a new version, bump the PATCH section of the version number.
- Use `uz.orientadvertise.services` as the group ID for the Maven project and base Java package.
- Do not use the Lombok library.
- Generate the Docker Compose file to run all components used by the application.
- Update README.md each time you generate a new version.
